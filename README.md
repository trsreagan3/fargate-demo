# sre-take-home

Your mission: To stand up and have a publicly-hosted end point available on port 8080 that we can access and get 200 response!

We want to see your creativity, but we have a few constraints for the exercise:

- Use of load balancer 
  - Round robin or other demonstrated configuration
- Use of Security Groups
- Uses containers
- Terraform Use to Reproduce your work  
- Use of Jenkinsfile so that we can build and deploy your solution. If you're looking for a Jenkinsfile validator, one exists via https://job-dsl.herokuapp.com/)
- Repo documented with a README.md file 

Nice to have: 

- Logs routed to Cloudwatch
- Documentation on approach to shipping updates to the solution with minimal / no downtime

For this, please use the honor method in your time spent - we look for 2-3 hours for this, respecting your time and supporting work/life balance, your commitments to things other than interviewing. <3

Once completed, please email the solution over to brenna.flood at splice.com.

Have fun, and good luck! 

Kelly, Jerius, and Brenna.
